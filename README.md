# libmemtester-rs

![pipeline](https://github.com/aeyno/libmemtester-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This project is a Rust library for testing memory. It is a Rust version of [memtester](https://pyropus.ca./software/memtester/).

The goal of this crate is to provide a cross-platform memory tester (it has been tested on Linux and Windows) that can be used in other projects.

It works by allocating a large chunk of memory and then writing a pattern to it. It then reads the memory and checks that the pattern is correct. It does this for a number of different patterns. If the memory is faulty, it will detect it and return a hashmap of the faulty addresses and the number of times they were faulty.

## âŒ¨ Usage

```rust
use libmemtester::MemTester;

fn main() {
    let size_to_allocate = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB
    let debug_prints = false; // If you want the debug prints

    // Create a new MemTester instance
    let mem_tests_res = MemoryTests::new(size_to_allocate, debug_prints);

    // Checking if there were any errors when allocating the memory
    if let Err(e) = mem_tests {
        println!("Error: {}", e);
        return;
    }
    let tests = mem_tests.unwrap();

    // We run the tests by calling an iterator
    // This way you can stop the tests when one fails
    // or simply display information as the tests goes along
    for let Some((test_name, error_count)) in tests.get_iterator() {
        println!("Test: {} - Error count: {}", test_name, error_count);
    }

    // When the iterator is done, we can get the results
    // This will return a hashmap of the faulty addresses and the number of times they were faulty
    let errors = tests.get_errors();
    println!("Errors: {:#?}", errors);
}
```
